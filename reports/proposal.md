# Project Proposal

### Project Goal

*What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.*

### Learning Goals

*What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?*

**Nate:** I hope to write a number of algorithms and improve my knowledge of the C language. In class so far, we've done a lot of smaller scale programming; implementing one method in a class for example. So, in accordance with this, I also want to structure our code in a nice, scalable way, such that adding another feature or expanding upon an existing one is simple and easy.

**Jeremy:** I am Jeremy.

**Ben:** I am Ben.

### Resources and Getting Started

*What do you need to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?*

### First Steps

*What are your first steps?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you can do immediately, and identify which member of the team will do them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?*

Our very first step will be creating an application window, displaying figures on that window, and receiving keystrokes and mouse events. Nate will be tackling this task. This step will be considered "done" when we can successfully display pixel values, images, and text to an application window and can successfully catch key and mouse events. This step is integral to the application, as we will not be able to make our tool interactive without being able to display information and receive input from the user.

Another first step is creating a GUI to allow the user to select different colors and tools. In this step, Ben will create scalable implementations of buttons, sliders, color pickers, and other graphical interfaces needed to allow the user to interact successfully with our paint algorithms.

The canvas is another first step that requires much thought. The canvas is required to have many features, like zooming, scaling, cropping, and the ability to be drawn on. Jeremy will implement the canvas and ensure that the user is able to utilize any tool they select on the canvas.
